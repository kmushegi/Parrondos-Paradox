## Parrondo's Paradox
This repository stores MATLAB code used to simulate Parrondo's Paradox and the paper describing our results. The Parrondoâ€™s Paradox is a seemingly absurd phenomenon where two losing strategies can be combined to produce a winning outcome. 
The [paper](https://github.com/kmushegi/Parrondos-Paradox/blob/master/parrondos-games.pdf) present in this repository represents 
an effort to analyze the 'paradox' and explain it using mathematics, namely linear algebra.

Figure below was generated using MATLAB. Game A and Game B are two losing games, Game C is comprised by randomly playing Game A and Game B.
As we can see Game C is a winning game.

The work on this project was done for the Intermediate Linear Algebra class at [Bowdoin College](https://bowdoin.edu) taught by 
[Professor Pietraho](http://www.bowdoin.edu/~tpietrah/), who always offered deep mathematical insight and guidance along the way. Parts
of the simulation code were kindly provided by Professor Pietraho.

This work was done as a group project with Parikshit Sharma, [Marcus Christiansen](https://github.com/MarcusEFC), 
and Ernesto Garcia without whom it would not be possible.
